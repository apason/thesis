author = {Gallant, John Kenneth},
title = {String Compression Algorithms},
year = {1982},
publisher = {Princeton University},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This thesis deals with three related problems involving strings, specifically, finding superstrings, the string sequencing problem, and macro compression schemes. In each section, the author shows several natural variants of the problem at hand to be computationally intractable (i.e., NP-complete). He then suggests a number of approximation algorithms and gives bounds on their performance.This work is well motivated, competently executed and constitutes an acceptable Ph.D. thesis. Sections of the work have already been accepted for journal publication.},

    of a finite number of keywords in a string of text. The algorithm consists of constructing
    a finite state pattern matching machine from the keywords and then using the pattern
    matching machine to process the text string in a single pass. Construction of the
    pattern matching machine takes time proportional to the sum of the lengths of the
    keywords. The number of state transitions made by the pattern matching machine in
    processing the text string is independent of the number of keywords. The algorithm
    has been used to improve the speed of a library bibliographic search program by a
    factor of 5 to 10.},

abstract = {Discrete optimization problems are everywhere, from traditional operations research planning problems, such as scheduling, facility location, and network design; to computer science problems in databases; to advertising issues in viral marketing. Yet most such problems are NP-hard. Thus unless P = NP, there are no efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions to such problems. This book shows how to design approximation algorithms: efficient algorithms that find provably near-optimal solutions. The book is organized around central algorithmic techniques for designing approximation algorithms, including greedy and local search algorithms, dynamic programming, linear and semidefinite programming, and randomization. Each chapter in the first part of the book is devoted to a single algorithmic technique, which is then applied to several different problems. The second part revisits the techniques but offers more sophisticated treatments of them. The book also covers methods for proving that optimization problems are hard to approximate. Designed as a textbook for graduate-level algorithms courses, the book will also serve as a reference for researchers interested in the heuristic solution of discrete optimization problems.}
